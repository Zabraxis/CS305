Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis financial had some issues concerning security, so I developed a plan to help them mitigate any possible security threats.
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
To be honest, I struggled at first when I started looking into their security threats, but I overcame the obstacles and I manage what I feel is a working mitigation plan for them.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Working with Eclipse and Maven was a nuissance, I very much dislike those programs, and still have some issueswith using them.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Security can be increasedin several ways, one of which is by using a higher level of encryption, and another was is certificates along with single sign on and other good practices.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By using Maven dependency check, it is a useful tool to ensure security threats that are found are able to be viewed by the user.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Everything that was used will come in handy at some poimt, but Eclipse and Maven will be the most used tools in all likelihood.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I have an entire folder on my computer that I can use to show employers, not just one item but various things, I also made a little game in Java that functions, which is helpful to show off as well.
